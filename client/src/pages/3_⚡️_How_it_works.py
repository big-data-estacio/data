st.markdown("""

Imagine a future where you can watch an animation video from a concept you have in your mind in a few seconds. That would be useful for teachers, students, and more. People that want to generate a video won't need to learn how to use a video editor, how to draw, or how to code. You just need to write a descriptive text.

That indeed is a future. And it's not that far. We can already start working on it.

Manim is a Python library for creating complex graphics and animations. The main advantage of Manim for GPT, it's that since it's a language for the LLM, it's more easy to generate proper code from a prompt.

I have a feel that a pure AI editor like [Runway](https://runwayml.com), or an advanced animation editor like [Jitter](https://jitter.video) could take advantage of a workflow like this:

The idea behind *Generative Manim* is test how far we can go with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

## Rendering problems

While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are able to generate good code. They have the following limitations:

- The information is limited up to 2021. That means Manim features that were added after 2021 won't be available.
- The code generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is not always correct.

:white_check_mark: At this moment, **Generative Manim** is able to render simple animations that rely on Manim and Math packages.

:x: But it's not able to render really complex animations that could require more lines of code that the limit of tokens provided by GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

## Costs implications

Currently GPT-4 is 30 times more expensive than GPT-3.5.

[GPT-4 costs 3 (input) to 6 (generated) cents for 1000 tokens, which is around 1 million tokens for $30](https://github.com/360macky/generative-manim/issues/2). That's a lot of money. But it's not that much if you think about the possibilities.

I would recommend you to use your own API Key if you want to use this app without character limits.
